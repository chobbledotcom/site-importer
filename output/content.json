We are based in Sidcup right by the borders of New Eltham, but also right beside the A20 so within a few minutes of Orpington (providing the A20 and Crittals Corner roundabout isn\\'t backed up) Being so local, we have knowledge of the area and the streets within and surrounding (perfect if you ever need an emergency call out).\n\nWe not only install brand new Burglar Alarm Systems and CCTV systems, we also service, fault find, repair, replace devices, upgrade and change alarm battery replacements. We also offer access control and door entry systems and have provided our services to quite a few schools in and around Orpington.\n\nWith Orpington being such a large area stretching from Sidcup right down to Pratts Bottom and across from the borders of Crockenhill and Chelsfield right over to Princess Royal Hospital (or the PRU if you\\'re local) and Petts Wood. Although Orpington comes under the London Borough of Bromley, I think if you\\'ve lived in or near Orpington for most of your life, its classed as Kent. Having so many green spaces around such as the beautiful High Elms Country park, just off of Green Street Green, its hard not to class this area as Kent especially when Kent is renowned for being the Garden of England.\n\nBeing located right on the border of London and Kent, the ULEZ expansion was something we never anticipated needing to consider. When it was announced that the ULEZ would extend to Orpington, many of our customers expressed concerns about needing to find another local security provider for their alarm systems or CCTV, or for services like alarm battery replacements and routine maintenance in Orpington and Bromley. To address these concerns, one of our first priorities was ensuring our vehicles met ULEZ standards, allowing us to continue providing CCTV and alarm system installations and maintenance in Orpington, and ensuring that home security services in the area remained uninterrupted.\n\nProviding home security in Orpington has always been one of our favourite places. The roads are easy to navigate and there is no better place for lunch than Michael\\'s food truck in Nugents! His curries are just the best! His coffee is lovely too. He has a van right outside Pret a Manger, just opposite Costa coffee in Nugents. Being a non height restrictive car park - which is hard to find and is a struggle for us as we have triple ladders on our van roofs which can reach a height of 9 metres, Nugents is the perfect place to stop by for something quick to eat and drink. With plenty of parking - all free too!\n\nSo if you are thinking of having a home security system installed or maybe you need a burglar alarm for your business instead, we can help with it all. We offer brand new installations as well as upgrades. You may already have an alarm system that works just fine but may need a service or a new battery, this is something we can help with. We offer servicing to all brands of alarm system. It doesnt matter that we didnt fit it, we have been in the security trade for a number of years so there isnt any alarm panels out there that we havent come across before.\n\nIf you are looking for a local, friendly and trusted home security sytems company in Orpington to service your current alarm system, get in touch. [Burglar Alarm Service in Orpington](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/servicing-and-repairs.php) and [Burglar Alarm Battery in Orpington](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/servicing-and-repairs.php).\n\nWe can create any package to suit your needs so if you need more or less sensors, or you would like an additional keypad or you want to add on some more keytags, we can help with it all.

At this point, you can simply tap on the area you want to set and the alarm system will then start the setting procedure for that area. It really is as simple and easy as that. Alternatively if any area is already set, tapping that area will turn it off.\n\nYou can open the app and check the status of your alarm system at any time. You can check the event log and even omit specific circuits if you have a friend staying in a room that may already have a sensor, meaning the rest of the system can be armed.\n\nIf your alarm system is triggered, you will then receive live descripted notifications of the specific room the alarm has been triggered and not only that, but if the intruder moves in to another room where a sensor is situated it will send that notification as well giving you confirmation that somebody is moving within the property.\n\nThis app lets you have complete control and confidence that your home is secure with MyAlarm Security.\n\nTake a look at some of our [popular burglar alarm system packages here](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php).

Maybe you need more room sensors or more window and door sensors? Maybe you have someone in the property who is deaf or hard of hearing? Or maybe you need extra keyfobs for the cleaner or your teenagers? Not a problem. We can create a package to suit your needs. We also offer [CCTV packages](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) as well as [Door Entry and Access Control](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/access-control.php).\n\nFeel free to [contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) with any questions or queries you may have. Our friendly team are always happy to help.\n\n![App Control](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/vqffat6itovowu9wnoiy.jpg)",

We are all for people doing it themsekves, but paying someone who hasnt got a clue is something we always try to advise against. Check that the person or company you have chosen is experienced, have a look at reviews, check they have the correct insurances and ask as many questions as you can.\n\nThis recent customer had just moved in to a property on the borders of Blackheath, Greenwich and Eltham and called us in to see if we could fix and take over the CCTV system.\n\nOn the image attached you can see huge water ingress and we all know water and any type of power (even low voltage) doesn\\'t mix well. This was all taken out and done properly, leaving our customer happy and their home protected.\n\nThe previous owner was apparently a builder but thought he was also a security installation specialist, but unfortunately if it\\'s not done right in the first place you will end up with trouble in no time.\n\nThings like the route the cables take to enter the junction box and common sense like if you poured water on the cable which way would it run are paramount.\n\nWe completely ripped out the old sytem and all of it\\'s cabling as it was not to the standard that we work hard to uphold.\n\nSome companies would have fixed the faults and took it on causing the customer lots of call outs (most likely chargeable everytime) to remedy ongoing faults, we however refused and explained the long term positives.\n\nNeedless to say the installation is now securely installed with no water ingress or trunking hanging off the wall.\n\nAnother happy customer.\n\nFor an idea on pricing, please see our [CCTV packages](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php).\n\n![Bad Installs](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/kro3qblolsyrxitpbf8c.jpg)",

      "content": "# Burglar Alarm and CCTV Systems Sidcup\n\nHere at MyAlarm Security, we are constantly keeping our eyes and ears open for the latest technology, versions and new equipment that is on the market. We are lucky enough to have fantastic relationships with our wholesalers, manufacturers and the sales and support teams for our chosen products which are Pyronix and Hik. They are both leading brands in their fields with customers all over the world.\n\nAlthough these are our chosen brands to install, having been in the security industry for well over 25 years, there isn\\'t many systems that we don\\'t know. We are often called out to systems where the homeowner cant remember who the original installer of the systems was and they need a service on their alarm system or a battery change in the burglar alarm panel or siren. This is something we are always happy to help with.\n\nBattery changes in alarm panels or the outside siren is something that should be done every couple of years at least to avoid a low battery or fault occurring. We find a lot of calls come from customers who have no idea what the make, model or brand of their system is which is fine. All we ask is for them to email us over a photo of their intruder alarm system and from that we will know the make, model and brand and will know exactly what battery is required. It really is as simple as that.\n\n[CCTV](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) installations are also on the rise. With a rise in theft of cars and packages left on doorsteps especially in the run up to Christmas, more and more people are choosing to install hard wired cctv that doesn\\'t rely on an internet connection. We find that a lot of people are put off by cables systems as they don\\'t want unsightly cables running down and across the front, back and sides of their property. Who does?! We hide as much cable as possible making the installation as aesthetically pleasing on the eye as possible. Customers are always so surprised at how well we hide our cables and how well positioned the cables and cameras are and thats because we take pride in our work and strongly believe that a satisfied customer is our biggest achievement. Word of mouth recommendations are by far loads better than any paid advert one can do. Happy customers is paramount to us and that is why we take so much pride in our work.\n\nWe are lucky enough to have some lovely customers across New Eltham, Bexley, Bromley, Orpington and surrounding areas who contact us for advice, recommendations for their friends, parents or even if they move house. We had one customer recently who moved up North which was too far for us to go. They sent us over their floor plans and from that we told them exactly what they will need and with that, they found a local company who they contacted and are now happy with their new system and have confidence in their new installer. So its not just current customers who we try to help, we really do try and go above and beyond to help out as much as possible. We offer free advice where we can and try to give our customers as many options as possible as we do strongly believe that good customer service costs nothing and goes a long way.\n\nSo, if you or someone you know needs their [home burglar alarm system](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) or maybe its your business burglar alarm system or [door entry or access control system](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/access-control.php) looking at, or maybe you would like a brand new installation or an upgrade or maybe you just have a fault that needs looking at, don\\'t hesitate to give us a call. Our office is open Monday - Friday 09:00 - 17:30. We are also available for emergency out of hours call out for [burglar alarm systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php).

These devices are easy to install - they just wrap round your steering wheel, or internally on your doors. When movement or vibration is detected, your property burglar alarm will activate.\n\nThese car defenders can be linked up to any of our wireless burglar alarm systems. They can have their own unique setting, so when you are in the premises and the vehicle is outside, you can arm just the vehicle sensor. It can also be programmed in to a bed set and any other settings you have on your alarm system.\n\nSee our [burglar alarm packages here](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) or alternatively [contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) to have one of these car defenders added to your system.\n\nHave a look at this video for full information on the car defender and see for yourself how it works: [](https://youtu.be/-ITA2MsqPCA) **[Car Defender Video](https://youtu.be/-ITA2MsqPCA)**[**.**](https://youtu.be/-ITA2MsqPCA)\n\n![Car Defender By Pyronix](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/nnxlqze2rajr4a3ty4xj.jpg)",

You are having a new floor fitted or a new carpet laid and the company have accidentally gone through the alarm system wire or have taken a chunk out of the cable. Or maybe you was taking up the old flooring and have gone through a cable. Quite often the flooring company will be aware and will notify the homeowner so therefore the damaged cable is visible and able to be repaired and the system back up and running again, but sometimes the flooring company might not even be aware or didn\\'t see the cable underneath the threshold or the underlay for example, so they are not aware that the cable has been damaged.  Its only when you come to set the system or notice there are lights flashing - or maybe even the siren is ringing that you realise there is a problem. Lots of people panic when the cable to their system has been damaged but this is something we have lots of experience with and have seen time and time again. If you don\\'t know where the damage is, we will be able to find it and repair it, or re-run the cable\\... Whatever the issue, we can help. Give us a call on 020 8302 4065.

      "content": "# [CCTV in London / Kent](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php)\n\nClosed-circuit television (CCTV) is a widely used technology in today\\'s world. It has become an important tool in public safety and security management. CCTV systems capture and record images over a specific area or location. These systems are commonly used by businesses, organisations, and individuals to monitor and record activities to deter crime and to provide evidence for investigations. CCTV technology is particularly important in London and Kent, where crime rates are relatively high.\n\nCCTV systems have become increasingly popular in London and Kent in recent years, and for good reason. We have installed many systems in and around New Eltham, Sidcup, Bexley, Greenwich, Blackheath, Orpington, Bromley, Sevenoaks and Dartford. CCTV is used to monitor and record a variety of activities, including theft, vandalism, and assault, among others. It is important for businesses and organisations to install CCTV systems, as it can deter criminal activities and provide evidence for investigations. It is also important for individuals to install the systems at their homes for the protection of their property and loved ones. We serve a variety of areas including Bexley, Dartford, Greenhithe, Bromley, Orpington, Petts Wood and surrounding areas.\n\nHere at MyAlarm Security, based in New Eltham / Sidcup, we offer a couple of different types of [CCTV systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php), each with its own set of features and benefits. Our CCTV packages both offer camera systems that record to a harddrive/recorder with approx 30 days storage. Our systems have an optional extra notification that can even detect movement and send alerts to your smart phone if movement is detected. These advanced features make CCTV systems important tools in crime prevention.\n\nCCTV systems are not only used to deter and prevent crime, but they can also provide valuable evidence for investigations. In London and Kent, CCTV footage has helped to convict numerous criminals and has been used as evidence in court. The footage provides a clear and unbiased record of events that can help to prove guilt or innocence.\n\nAnother important benefit of CCTV systems is that they can help to improve public safety and security. CCTV systems can be used to monitor public areas, such as parks, streets, and public buildings. This can help to deter criminal activities and make the areas safer for residents and visitors alike.\n\nIn summary, CCTV systems are important tools in public safety and security management. They can help to deter and prevent crime, provide evidence for investigations, and improve public and personal safety in London and Kent. CCTV systems come in a variety of types, each with its own set of features and benefits. As crime rates continue to rise in London and Kent, it is important for businesses, organisations, and individuals to install CCTV systems to protect themselves and their property.\n\nSo if you are thinking of having [CCTV](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) installed at your home or business, then don\\'t hesitate to get in contact.

Maybe the company was sold, the owners retired or the company was re-branded. Whatever the reason, this is definitely something we are able to help with.\n\n[Burglar Alarm](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) Systems & [CCTV](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) - [Service, Repair, Upgrades, New Systems, Decommissions](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/servicing-and-repairs.php). We are specialists in all types of home and business security with well over 25 years experience. There isn\\'t many alarm panels on the market that we don\\'t know. We offer alarm servicing & battery changes without the hefty contracted monthly and yearly payments. We understand that not everyone wants to be tied into a contract so we offer call outs as and when needed. You just pay for us when you need or want us. It doesn\\'t matter that we didn\\'t install your alarm system, having been in the trade for as long as we have, we know most panels inside out and carry stock including alarm batteries and replacement sensors on board our vans at all times.\n\nOur market research has shown that our customers much prefer the freedom of not being tied into a contract. Some customers like to have their systems serviced every year or maybe your insurance stipulates this as part of your policy but we also found that some wanted to wait a little bit longer before having a service done. Whatever your reasons, we can help you out without the hefty monthly price tag.\n\nSo you have an existing intruder alarm system that you would like looked at, serviced, repaired or upgraded? Maybe the batteries need replacing or the keypad no longer works? Or maybe you\\'re having decorating done or home improvements and need a sensor or door contact removed or replaced? Do you have an error message or warning light displayed or flashing on the alarm panel? One of the first things we will ask is \\'what is the brand or model of alarm system that you have?\\' Lots of alarm systems don\\'t have any visible names on them, or maybe the name has rubbed off. Some alarm panels just have numbers on! Believe it or not, we can identify an alarm panel just from these numbers. Maybe your alarm system says Visonic or Veritas, or just has the numbers 9651. If you don't know the make or model of your system, just send us a photo of the alarm panel and we can identify it for you. Our email address is Sales@MyAlarmSecurity.Co.UK or [click here to contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) direct.\n\nMaybe you're looking to have an existing system upgraded or a brand new system fitted.

      "content": "# Home Security Systems: A Necessity in London and Kent?\n\nHome Security Systems: A Necessity in London and Kent?\n\nOne of the most effective methods of protecting ones property is by investing in a reliable [home security system](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/special-offers.php). The importance of having a security system cannot be overstated, as it provides an added layer of protection for both your family and your valuables. In this article, we'll explore why home security systems are a necessity in London and Kent. We are based in Sidcup which is in the London Borough of Bexley but with a Kent postcode however we are right on the borders of New Eltham which is in the London Borough of Greenwich and has a London postcode.\n\nCrime Rate in London and Kent\n\nBurglary rates in both London and Kent have seen a steady increase over the past few years. In 2020 alone, the Metropolitan Police recorded over 65,000 home burglaries in London. That's an average of 180 burglaries per day. Similarly, in Kent, the crime rate has seen an increase of 6.8% in 2021, with burglary being one of the top crimes. With such alarming figures, lots of homeowners and business owner are taking the necessary precautions to secure their homes and businesses.\n\nImportance of Home Security Systems\n\nHaving a home security system installed is an excellent way to protect your property from intruders. A security system not only provides peace of mind but also acts as a deterrent for burglars. At MyAlarm security, we can create any package to suit your property layout and requirements to include sensors (door contacts) placed at doors and windows, motion detectors, and a central control panel. The system is designed to alert the homeowner if there is a break-in attempt. We also offer keytags and keyfobs for ease of setting/unsetting which can be used as a panic button. Have a read up on one of our other blogs here about the system we use: [Pyronix Alarm System.](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/blog/pyronix-alarm-system.php)\n\nIn addition to burglary prevention, home security systems also allow homeowners to monitor their homes remotely. With the advancements in technology, it's possible to receive live alerts on your smartphone or computer when there is an attempted break-in or any other sensor activations.\n\nChoosing the Right Home Security System\n\nSelecting the right home security system can be daunting. However, it's important to consider your specific needs and budget. Here at MyAlarm Security, we can work with you and go through your property and advise the best placements of sensors for maximum coverage. We can also show you a demo kit which shows what the equipment looks like.\n\nIt's also essential to consider the reputation of the security company you choose. Ensure that the company is insured, and has a good track record of customer satisfaction. Homeowners should also check if the security system meets the British Standards Institution (BSI) certification, ensuring that the system meets the required standards for security systems in the UK.

However, it's vital to consider the cost of not having a security system. Whilst a security system may be an initial upfront cost, the value it provides in terms of protection and peace of mind is immeasurable. We have created some packages for you to have a look at and to work out roughly how much an [alarm system](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) is.

In response to this, many homeowners are now looking to install advanced [burglar alarm systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) and [CCTV](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) at their homes to protect their property and loved ones.\n\nWith the latest advancements in home security technology, there are many options available for homeowners to choose from. Some systems can be integrated with home automation and can alert the homeowner through their smartphone or tablet if there is any activity detected on their property. These systems not only deter burglars but also make it easier for authorities to identify perpetrators and apprehend them.\n\nMany homeowners are also opting for wireless systems that are easy to install and cost-effective. These systems can be monitored remotely, 24/7, ensuring that any suspicious activity is immediately detected and reported to the authorities.\n\nIn addition to providing peace of mind, investing in a burglar alarm system can also lower homeowners\\' insurance premiums, saving them money in the long run.\n\nWe are based in New Eltham / Sidcup and cover a large area including Bromley, Orpington, Dartford, Greenhithe, Gravesend, Greenwich, Sevenoaks and surrounding areas.\n\n[Contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) with any questions you may have.

      "content": "# Not sure if you should get a Burglar Alarm?\n\nInvesting in a [home burglar alarm](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) system offers numerous benefits, contributing to enhanced security and peace of mind. Here are several compelling reasons why getting a home burglar alarm is a wise decision:\n\n1.  **Deterrence of Burglars:** A visible burglar alarm system acts as a powerful deterrent for potential intruders. Knowing that your home is equipped with a security system makes it less likely for burglars to target your property, as they prefer easier targets without such protective measures. All of our alarm systems come with a siren (bellbox) for the front of the property and a decoy box for the rear. Additional can be added if required.\n\n2.  **Immediate Notification:** Our smart [burglar alarm systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) can instantly notify you, via the app if a security breach is detected. This rapid notification allows for quick response times, increasing the likelihood of preventing or minimizing potential losses. Please note that an active app subscription and internet connection is needed in order for the app to work.\n\n3.  **Protection of Valuables:** [Burglar alarms](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) safeguard your valuable possessions, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents. The presence of an alarm system discourages thieves from attempting to steal valuable items, providing an additional layer of protection for your assets.\n\n4.  **Enhanced Safety for Occupants:** The primary purpose of a [home burglar alarm](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) is to protect the occupants. In the event of a break-in, the alarm system can alert you and your family, allowing everyone to take appropriate action, such as seeking refuge or contacting authorities. Various settings can be added on to the system. The system can be set when occupants are home - such as at bed time or a perimeter set, which allows certain sensors to be turned off/on.\n\n5.  **Integration with Smart Home Devices:** Our [smart burglar alarm](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) systems integrate with smart home devices, allowing you to monitor and control your security system remotely. This includes features such as arming and disarming the system, receiving real-time alerts, and checking security camera feeds using a mobile app. An active app subscription is required for using this feature.\n\n6.  **Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your home is equipped with a burglar alarm system provides a sense of security and peace of mind. Whether you\\'re at home or away, you can rest assured that your property is being protected, and you\\'ll be promptly alerted to any potential threats.\n\n7.  **Protection During Holidays:** When you\\'re away on holiday or business trips, a burglar alarm system ensures that your home remains protected. Remote monitoring and alerts allow you to stay informed about the security status of your property, even when you\\'re miles away.\n\nIn summary, a [home burglar alarm](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) system provides a range of benefits, from deterring potential intruders to offering peace of mind and protecting your valuables. It is a practical investment in the safety and security of your home and loved ones.\n\n[Contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) for more information or have a browse on our website at some of our packages.

When we received our new van in a pristine white it looked amazing but we knew the best way to advertise locally in and around Bexley and Orpington was to get it sign written. Along with a website and leaflets, we decided that having our van sign written lets everyone know what we do. We decided to go with a local company to do our van signage after seeing lots of designs of their work which we were very happy with.\n\nAfter hours with our designer at their offices in Bexley and lots and lots of amendments to the design, we was given a computer generated preview of our van wrap which looked great. We finally approved the deisgn and we dropped the van off this week in Orpington, Bromley to have the work carried out and are over the moon with the outcome. We think the design looks very vibrant, eye catching and modern.\n\nWe decided to keep in with our colours of red and white but also went with black text for our contact details so that they can be easily read and copied by our potential customers as we drive past. Our van wrap includes our MyAlarm logo, our contact details and all of the social networking sites that we are on including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We also had our QR code put on to the van so when you are passing, you can scan the QR code using your phone which will take you straight to our website. How cool is that?!\n\nWith our van parked outside your premises, it also lets anyone passing know that your property is in the process of having one of our security systems installed either a [Burglar Alarms or CCTV](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/special-offers.php) or both.\n\nWith the majority of our local work around Greenwich, New Eltham, Sidcup, Welling, Bexley, Bromley, Dartford and Orpington we are sure to turn some heads. We cant be missed in our van and are confident that our design not only looks good but also signifies what we do.\n\nLet us know what you think?\n\n![Our New Van Now Has Sign Writing](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/kn42g7zs2azc8bgruixg.jpg)",

      "content": "# 24/7 Out Of Hours Call Out in New Eltham / Chislehurst \n\nSilent Night, Alarming Christmas: A Tale of an Emergency Callout For A House Alarm in New Eltham / Chislehurst.\n\n\\'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except for the blaring sound of a house alarm echoing through the silent streets of Chislehurst. The festive atmosphere was shattered as the alarm wailed relentlessly, disturbing the peace of the tranquil holiday night. For the weary homeowners, it was a nightmare scenario -- an out-of-hours emergency callout was necessary to silence the intrusive alarm in Chislehurst.\n\nChapter 1: The Festive Disruption\n\nThe evening had started like any other Christmas Eve, with families nestled snug in their homes, celebrating the joyous occasion. The twinkling lights on the trees illuminated living rooms, and the scent of holiday feasts filled the air. However, one particular household found itself in the midst of an unforeseen predicament.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the calm ambiance was shattered by the blaring siren of the house alarm. Panic set in for the residents, who rushed to identify the source of the disturbance. The culprit was a low battery on the outside siren, triggering the alarm and casting a shadow over the festive cheer.\n\nChapter 2: Desperate Measures\n\nWith the alarm showing no signs of mercy, and the homeowner unable to get hold of the originbal installer, the decision was made to contact MyAlarm Security. However, it was Christmas Eve, and the realization that a swift resolution might not be possible began to sink in. Nonetheless, with the holiday spirit alive in their hearts, the homeowners dialed the number, hoping for a Christmas miracle.\n\nChapter 3: The Emergency Callout\n\nOn the other end of the line, a weary but dedicated operator picked up the call, ready to assist in the most unusual of situations. The homeowners explained the predicament, desperation evident in their voices. We took the call, showing commendable empathy, assured them that help was on the way, despite the holiday festivities.\n\nMatt attended the call out which was on the borders of New Eltham and Chislehurst. Donning his uniform on this chilly Christmas Eve, he navigated the quiet streets to reach the location of the festive emergency. The promise of a silent night hung in the air, albeit with the challenge of restoring peace to the disrupted household and New Eltham / Chislehurst neighbourhood.\n\nChapter 4: Technological Tango\n\nUpon arrival, MyAlarm Security wasted no time in assessing the situation. Armed with extra long ladders and a wealth of experience, Matt approached the house with a sense of purpose. The blaring alarm served as a constant reminder of the urgency of their mission.\n\nMatt immiediatly put on his head torch, erected his ladders and delved into the intricacies of the alarm system, navigating through the bushes below.\n\nChapter 5: A Silent Christmas Victory\n\nAs Matt disarmed the rogue siren and reset the alarm system, the once-piercing siren gradually faded into the background. The silent night was restored, and peace returned to the household just in time for the clock to strike one on Christmas morning.\n\nMyAlarm Security, having successfully completed their Christmas Eve mission, wished the homeowners a Merry Christmas and left the scene with holiday cheer in their hearts. The grateful residents, now able to return to their festivities, expressed their gratitude for the dedication and expertise of the emergency callout team.\n\nConclusion: A Tale of Christmas Resilience\n\nIn the end, this Christmas Eve emergency callout turned out to be a unique and memorable experience for all involved. It showcased the resilience of technology, the dedication of emergency service providers, and the ability of a community to come together, even in the face of unexpected disruptions.\n\nAnd so, with the alarm silenced and peace restored, the residents returned to their celebrations, cherishing the tale of the Christmas Eve emergency callout as a reminder that even in the most unexpected moments, the spirit of togetherness and resilience can prevail.\n\nIf you have an issue with your alarm system - even if we did not install it, we can still help!

All we see lately around Sidcup, New Eltham, Bromley, Orpington, Petts Wood, Bexley and Chislehurst is how burglaries are taking place with the entry point through the glazing of the doors.\n\nIn our experience, they seem to find anything heavy like a nearby flower pot or something from a rockery etc and then throw this through the door and walk in. They certainly don\\'t seem to be doing things quietly and carefully anymore.\n\nThe local police have suggested on every street meeting that a [burglar alarm security system](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) is a sure fire way of potentially deterring these thieves away from your property and your belongings.\n\nOur \\'[Pet Package](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/products/pet-package-849.php)\\' is the perfect start of a complete smart home security burglar alarm system with perimeter protection with the back up of a couple of movement sensors on the inside.\n\nOur aim is to trigger the alarm before any movement is detected on the inside and this will hopefully be enough to scare the thieves away and not come back.

      "content": "# [**Petts Wood Alarm System Upgrade and CCTV Package**] \n\nWe recently was asked to attend a property where the homeowner had sadly had their car stolen off of their drive. Car theft seems to be rife recently with more and more cars being stolen. \n\nThe homeowners property was not broken into so the thieves obviously used some sort of jamming device to access the car and start it up to drive away.\n\nThe customers alarm system was over 20 years old and they had never used it. We upgraded their whole burglar alarm system and added the brand new Pyronix car defender to it for their new car. The car defender is a device that is linked up to your Pyronix home alarm system and when it feels vibration or is tilted in anyway, this activates your home alarm system triggering the siren. The car defender can be linked around the steering wheel so that if someone gets into your car and touches the steering wheel, if the alarm is activated, the siren on the house alarm will sound. \n\nWe also added a 5 camera CCTV system to their property with two CCTV cameras at the front, one down the side and two at the rear with one covering the shed entrance.\n\nBoth systems will have app control allowing the homeowner to view the surroundings of his home from anywhere in the world - or from any room in the house. If you hear a sound at night, its quick and easy to view your cameras from your mobile phone.  The house alarm can also be set and unset from the app, allowing the homeowner to have total control over his home security.\n\nThe alarm system app allows certain zones/areas/rooms to be set at different times so that if you are in the property and would for example, just like the front door, garden door and certain room sensors to be set, this can be done from within the app as well, giving you total control over your system.\n\nThis homeowner is now protected with the latest Burglar Alarm System and CCTV in Petts Wood. \n\n[Contact us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) is you have any questions or would like further information on any of our systems. We are a family run company based in Sidcup and cover Orpington, Bromley, Petts Wood, Dartford, Knockholt, Crockenhill, Bexley, Greenwich, Gravesend, Erith, Sevenoaks and surrounding areas.\n\n![Petts Wood Alarm System Upgrade And Cctv Package](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/)",

Over the years we have used many different brands or burglar alarms and sensors and think that these are most definitely the best. When movement is detected, it will trigger your security alarm with an internal and external siren. Via the app, you will then be notified on your mobile device exactly where in the property the activation has occured.\n\nI think the thing i really like about these are that the wired [burglar alarm systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) and wireless versions look identical which is really nice for the end user because if we fit a hybrid system of wired and wireless security systems within your home or business premises, then we can keep the detectors universal and as aesthetically pleasing as possible.\n\nToday we had a job in Sidcup, Bexley, Kent to add an additional wired detector to the existing house alarm system and as you can see with some tricky drilling we managed to make a wired sensor actually look wireless.\n\nWe\\'re very proud to use all of our knowledge and expertise to give you guys the best finish we can.\n\n![Pir Movement Sensor](//res.cloudinary.com/kbs/image/upload/xxytbtvtzfzu9anqgwbd.jpg)",

This customer in Chislehurst had a basic system around 20 years old which kept going off at all hours of the day and night giving the customer (and their neighbours) many sleepless nights.\n\nThe customer called us to ask for a quotation to upgrade and whilst on site we had a quick look at no charge to see if we could identify the fault to at least silence the system and give the customer a good nights sleep. Not only did we identify that the back up battery was most likely the culprit but we also disconnected it due to it being swollen and leaking and being a potential fire hazard. We left a safe system that was no longer going to disrupt her sleep.\n\nOn the security alarm system quotation the customer explained that she often looks after a family members dog and that she has to completely omit certain sensors to give a free roam for the dog, we explained about the benefits of upgrading the 15 year old sensors to [pet friendly](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/products/pet-package-849.php) ones that would mean leaving the system with full protection as well as giving the dog its run around.\n\nWe go above and beyond to make sure the customers requirements are met to the highest possible standard.\n\nOf course all wired upgrades benefit from our complimentary backlit siren for the full effect.\n\nWe can build any package to suit your property or requirements.

      "content": "# Burglar Alarms \n\nWhy wait until a break in or an attempted break in to have home security or a burglar alarm fitted? With so many burglaries and attempted break-ins, don\\'t leave it until its to late. Protect what is yours and deter any intruders by installing a **MyAlarm Security Burglar Alarm System**.\n\nBased in Sidcup, [Bexley](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/bexley.php) on the borders of New Eltham, London and Kent, we offer a free survey/design where our highly skilled engineers will go through all the options with you. We don\\'t send out a sales guy who has never picked up a tool and who just gives you a sales pitch, we send an experienced engineer who knows exactly what they are talking about and can explain all the features of the system that they will be installing along with advising the best positions for the equipment. With over 30 years of experience in domestic and commercial security, our engineers know the equipment and security systems they fit inside out.\n\nWe offer the latest in smart technology with home and business intruder alarms that can be linked to your smart phone or tablet. The systems can be fully app controlled from anywhere in the world providing there is an internet connection and an active app subscription. Our burglar alarms systems also send live, descriptive notifications, notifying you if your intruder alarm has been activated and in what room the activation occurred and with a number of different ways to set/unset the system using a PIN, a key fob, a remote or via the app, it really is easy to protect what is yours for your own peace of mind.\n\nWireless technology has come so far over the years and is now as reliable as a wired home security house alarm or business premises alarm system, but without the disruption of adding cables in and around your property.\n\nWe have created some packages which have been extremely popular, however we can also tailor build any package to suit your property or requirements. Additional movement sensors, vibration sensors, door contacts, [strobe lights](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/blog/wireless-sounder-alarm-system-for-the-deaf-or-hard-of-hearing.php) for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, key fobs and key tags can be added to (or removed from) any of our packages.\n\nWe also offer pet friendly sensors so that your animal friends do not activate the alarm when it is set. These pet friendly motion sensors can be used for pets up to approx 24kg and are a great way of keeping peace of mind whilst leaving your pets to roam their home.\n\nAll of our burglar alarm systems can be programmed with various settings so you can have a full set for when you are out of the house which would arm all sensors and contacts or a night time set which arms certain sensors whilst you sleep (allowing you to go to the bathroom during the night for example without setting the whole alarm off). You can also pick and choose within the app to arm/disarm any of the sensors at any time.\n\nWhat does the app do?\n\nThe app allows you to set and unset your alarm from anywhere in the world providing you have internet. The app will also alert you if your alarm is activated and will notify you which sensor/s have been triggered. An active internet connection and app subscription is required for app use. The app subscription is free for the first year after installation. If you would like to continue with the app, there is a £20 annual subscription fee to be paid. If you do not wish to resubscribe to the app, this does not affect your alarm system in any way and it can still be set and unset from the panel however you will not be able to remotely access through the app or receive any notifications whilst you are away from the property.\n\nServicing and maintaining your system.\n\nAs with everything, equipment and batteries have a life span. The manufacturer suggests that internal batteries for wireless systems can last approximately 12-18 months but should be replaced annually to avoid any low battery system faults. We recommend that panel batteries and the external bell siren battery should be replaced every 2 years unless showing as a low battery fault on your panel before this time.\n\nAlready have an alarm?\n\nHave an existing alarm system that you would like looked at, [serviced, repaired or upgraded](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/servicing-and-repairs.php)? Maybe it needs some battery changes or is showing a fault? We\\'ve been in the trade for well over 30 years and know most alarm system brands - both old and new, so don\\'t hesitate to get in contact. We service alarm systems both old and new regardless of who it was installed by. So if your system needs an alarm battery, [Contact Us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) and we can help. Don\\'t worry if you don\\'t know the make or model of your system, just send us a photo of the panel and we can ID it for you. From replacing a worn keypad to a full upgrade we can do it all. [Contact Us](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) [](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/contact.php) for more information.\n\nWhy not pair one of our Home Burglar Alarm Systems with a professionally installed [CCTV System](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) [](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) for the ultimate in home and business security.\n\n**Take a look in our** [**Special Offers**](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/special-offers.php) **area to view our excellent pre built** [**CCTV**](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/cctv.php) **and Burglar Alarm Packages.**\n\n**We are a family run business based in Sidcup right on the borders of New Eltham.

With the ability to keep an eye on your premises and loved ones, and to deter unwanted intruders, CCTV systems provide a range of benefits. As well as the peace of mind that comes with monitoring everything that happens on your property, CCTV footage can also be used as visual evidence in the event of a break-in or theft from the property.\n\nAt MyAlarm Security, we offer CCTV systems with a minimum storage period of approx 30 days, so you never have to worry about missing an incident. With our remote access, you can view live feeds and recorded video footage from anywhere in the world providing you have an internet connection, via a laptop, phone, or tablet. Our smart search feature also allows you to filter footage by movement or specific time periods, making it easy to review footage quickly.\n\nOur CCTV systems are installed by experienced engineers with a focus on providing the best coverage possible. We understand that cabling can be a concern for some customers, which is why we strive to keep our installations as neat and discreet as possible with minimal cables on show.\n\nOur new 24-hour CCTV packages with Full Colour technology have been particularly popular, and we now offer them alongside our most popular [intruder alarm systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php). ColorVu technology provides full-colour images day and night, using a large iris and high-performance sensor to achieve sharp, valuable images even in low light conditions. With full app integration for remote viewing, our ColorVu packages offer the latest in smart technology.\n\nWe also offer wireless [Burglar Alarm Systems](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/categories/burglar-alarms.php) that can also be linked with your smart phone or tablet, and fully app-controlled from anywhere with an internet connection. We have a range of packages available on our website, with special offers designed to suit different requirements and properties. Alternatively, you can contact us to discuss your needs and receive personalised advice and a package created to suit you. Take a look at the images below to see the difference between conventional cameras (colour in the day and black and white in the evening) and our ColorVu camera (24hr colour). MyAlarm Security is based in Sidcup on the borders of New Eltham, and we serve surrounding boroughs including [Orpington](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/orpington.php), [Bromley](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/bromley.php), [Dartford](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/dartford.php), [Bexley](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/bexley.php), [Gravesend](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/gravesend.php), [Sevenoaks](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/sevenoaks.php) and [Greenwich](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk/pages/greenwich.php).\n\nThe image below shows the differences at night time between a conventional camera (5mp analogue) and a Colorvu camera. Both camera types show up full colour during the day however the conventional cameras only offer black and white night time imaging. ColorVu cameras provide 24hr colour images.\n\n![CCTV Systems](/images/categories/categories-cctv-fz8jnnwdtcm5voycphbt.png)",

Arrived at about 6pm, looked at the mains box in garage, disconnected power and job done. Firstly I was delighted he was able to call at short notice and fix my problem but also it was a delight to meet somebody who is good at what they do and does not try and rip you off when the job is done. A great big thank you to Matt and would thoroughly recommend him.",
